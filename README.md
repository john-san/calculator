# TOP Foundations Project #5: Calculator
This project's objective was to create a calculator. 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The user can perform the essential functions of a calculator: add, subtract, mulitply, and divide. In addition, the user can modify the input by converting the sign, adding a decimal, or adding the percentage sign.

The user can click or use their keyboard to interact with the calculator.

The design of the app is based off the Samsung calculator design.

I was able to practice conditional logic and also practice working with classes and objects through this project.
